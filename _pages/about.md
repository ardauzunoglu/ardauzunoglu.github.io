## Hi there!

I am a second-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu). I am also an undergraduate research intern at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu) at JHU, supervised by [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

Prior to my research experience at JHU, I was also a research intern at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr), where I was supervised by [Gözde Gül Şahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io).

## Research Interests

Broadly, I am interested in leveraging language as a means to replicate intelligence in machines. To me, this covers topics from extracting implicit knowledge from texts to the utilization of language as a computational tool, and any intermediate steps in doing so. Regardless, I am eager about exploring diverse topics to further refine and shape my interests.
